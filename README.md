### Hey, I'm Karan and welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I am currently a postgraduate student at the University of Warwick studying Scientific Computing. My interests are within the fusion of applied machine/deep learning, low-level programming, high-performance computing and computational statistics. I am eager to leverage low‑level programming to apply machine/deep learning algorithms to improve existing systems and overcome challenges across various domains.

💻 I love programming in Python, C++, SQL, R and AMPL. I am currently learning to read and interpret x86-64 Assembly (Intel and AT&T syntax).

👉 Feel free to connect and reach out to me on LinkedIn, I love discussing nerdy topics with others!

🗨️ My favourite quote: "__We are all merely explorers of infinity, in the pursuit of absolute perfection.__"
